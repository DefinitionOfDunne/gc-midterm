Once upon a time in the mystical land of downtown Detroit there dwelt an immortal named David and his trusty band of students.
Unbeknownst to many, the students were dedicated to only one thing more than David... Banana milk.
However resources were scarce, and the banana milk was in short supply due to deforestation.  They competed with their mortal foes, the kung-fu sloths, for the precious elixer.
As David once said thousands of years ago, "desperate times call for desperate measures", and the students were left with no choice. They decided to team up with the kung-fu sloths and do the impossible: kill the Great David.

With their various masteries in the martial arts, both groups were commited to the task removing power from the great David; their future, and banana milk depended on it.
