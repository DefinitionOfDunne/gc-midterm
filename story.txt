Once upon a time in the mystical land of Shangrila there dwelt an immortal named Kai-Yun and his trusty band of students.
Unbeknownst to many, the students were dedicated to only one thing more than Kai-Yun... Banana milk.
However resources were scarce, and the banana milk was in short supply due to deforestation.  The students competed with their mortal foes, the kung-fu sloths, for the precious elixer.
As Kai-Yun once said thousands of years ago, "desperate times call for desperate measures", and the students were left with no choice. They decided to team up with the kung-fu sloths and do the impossible: kill the Great Kai-Yun.
With their various masteries in the martial arts, both groups were committed to the task removing power from the great Kai-Yun; their future, and banana milk depended on it.
